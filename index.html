        Don't you worry there, my honey
        We might not have any money
        But we've got our love to pay the bills

        Maybe I think you're cute and funny
        Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you, if you know what I mean

        Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the south of France
        Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance
        Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain making everybody look like ants
        From way up there, you and I, you and I

        Well, you might be a bit confused
        And you might be a little bit bruised
        But baby how we spoon like no one else
        So I will help you read those books
        If you will soothe my worried looks
        And we will put the lonesome on the shelf

        Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the south of France
        Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance
        Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain making everybody look like ants
        From way up there, you and I, you and I

        Oh let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the south of France
        Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance
        Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain making everybody look like ants
        From way up there, you and I, you and I
